        "\n",
        "1. **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python's syntax is straightforward and resembles natural language, making it easy to learn, especially for beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line by the interpreter, meaning you don’t need to compile it before running. This makes development faster and easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamically Typed**: Python doesn't require you to declare variable types. Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you can assign values of different types to the same variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which encourages code reusability and the creation of modular programs through classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-Platform**: Python is platform-independent, meaning the same Python code can run on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Extensive Standard Library**: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules and packages for a wide variety of tasks, such as file I/O, system operations, and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Third-Party Libraries**: In addition to the standard library, Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask) that extend its functionality for specific applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **High-Level Language**: Python abstracts complex details, such as memory management, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing the computer's hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Garbage Collection**: Python has automatic memory management, including garbage collection, which helps in managing memory by automatically removing unused objects from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Readable and Concise Syntax**: Python emphasizes readability, which makes it easy to maintain and debug code. It uses indentation instead of braces to define blocks of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Supports Multiple Paradigms**: Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, giving developers flexibility in how they structure their code.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Python has many IDEs and code editors, such as PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Visual Studio Code, which help with debugging, testing, and writing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Robust Community Support**: Python has a large and active community that contributes to its vast documentation, tutorials, and forums, making it easier for developers to find help.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Integration with Other Languages**: Python can be easily integrated with other languages like C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, allowing for performance optimization when necessary.\n",

        "A **variable** in Python is a symbolic name that refers to a value stored in memory. In Python, variables are used to store data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and other data types. When you assign a value to a variable, Python automatically creates the variable and assigns it the value. Unlike many other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to explicitly declare the variable type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics of Variables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Typing**: Python automatically determines the type of a variable at runtime based on the value assigned to it. You don't need to declare the type explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10         # Integer\n",
        "   y = \"Hello\"    # String\n",
        "   z = [1, 2, 3]  # List\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No Need for Declaration**: In Python, you don't need to declare a variable before using it. You simply assign a value to it and Python will create the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   a = 5        # No need to declare type\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Variable Names**: Variables in Python must follow certain naming rules:\n",
        "   - They can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).\n",
        "   - A variable name must **start** with a letter or an underscore (it cannot start with a digit).\n",
        "   - Keywords (like `if`, `else`, `def`) cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example of valid variable names:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   age = 25\n",
        "   user_name = \"Alice\"\n",
        "   totalAmount = 100.5\n",
        "   _result = 42\n",

        "   total amount = 5 # Cannot contain spaces\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Assignment**: In Python, variables are created by assigning a value to them using the `=` operator (this is different from many other languages, where `=` is used for comparison).\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 100  # Assigning an integer value to x\n",
        "   name = \"Alice\"  # Assigning a string value to name\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Multiple Assignment**: Python allows assigning values to multiple variables in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # Assigning values to multiple variables\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Reassignment**: Variables in Python can be reassigned to new values at any time, and their type can also change during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10      # x is an integer\n",
        "   x = \"Hello\" # Now x is a string\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Global and Local Variables**: Variables can be defined within functions (local) or outside them (global).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Local variables**: Defined within a function, they are only accessible inside that function.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     def my_function():\n",
        "         local_var = 5  # Local variable\n",
        "         print(local_var)\n",
        "     \n",
        "     my_function()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Global variables**: Defined outside any function and accessible anywhere in the program.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     global_var = 10  # Global variable\n",
        "     \n",
        "     def print_global():\n",
        "         print(global_var)  # Accessing global variable\n",
        "     \n",
        "     print_global()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Constants**: Python does not have true constants (like `const` in some other languages). However, by convention, you can use **uppercase variable names** to indicate that a variable is a constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   MAX_SPEED = 120  # Convention for constants\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Data Types of Variables**: Variables in Python can store various data types, including:\n",
        "   - **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `x = 5`)\n",
        "   - **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `y = 3.14`)\n",
        "   - **Strings**: Text (e.g., `name = \"Alice\"`)\n",
        "   - **Lists**: Ordered collection of items (e.g., `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`)\n",
        "   - **Tuples**: Immutable collection of items (e.g., `coordinates = (10, 20)`)\n",
        "   - **Dictionaries**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`)\n",
        "   - **Booleans**: True or False values (e.g., `is_active = True`)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Python supports **single-line comments** and **multi-line comments**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Single-line Comments**\n",
        "Single-line comments are used for short explanations or notes that are placed on a single line. They start with the **hash symbol (`#`)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# This is a single-line comment\n",

        "Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages. However, you can use multiple single-line comments or a multi-line string (triple quotes) to simulate multi-line comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using multiple single-line comments:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# This is the first line of a multi-line comment\n",
        "# This is the second line\n",
        "# This is the third line\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) for multi-line comments:\n",
        "Triple quotes are technically used for docstrings, but they can also be used to create multi-line comments.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Be concise**: Write comments that are clear and to the point. Avoid unnecessary comments.\n",
        "- **Use comments to explain \"why\"**: Comments should generally explain why the code is doing something, not just what it is doing. The \"what\" should be clear from the code itself.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using `sep` and `end`:**\n",
        "   - **`sep`**: Used to change the separator between printed objects.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(\"Hello\", \"world\", sep=\"-\")  # Prints: Hello-world\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **`end`**: Used to change the string added at the end of the output.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(\"Hello\", end=\" \")  # Output: Hello (without newline)\n",
        "     print(\"world\")          # Output: world (on the same line)\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a **function** is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be executed whenever called. Functions are fundamental to organizing and structuring your code, allowing for code reuse, better readability, and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Functions in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Defining a Function**\n",
        "   To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, and parentheses that may contain parameters. After that, you write the block of code that the function will execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def function_name(parameters):\n",
        "       # code block\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet():\n",
        "       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calling a Function**\n",
        "   Once a function is defined, you can call it by using its name followed by parentheses. If the function requires parameters, you pass the appropriate values inside the parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   greet()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Parameters and Arguments**\n",
        "   Functions can accept **parameters** (also called arguments). These are values passed into the function when it is called, and they allow the function to work with different data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name):\n",
        "       print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "   greet(\"Bob\")    # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return Statement**\n",
        "   Functions can return values using the `return` statement. This allows the function to send back a result when it finishes execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add(a, b):\n",
        "       return a + b\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "   result = add(5, 3)\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Default Parameters**\n",
        "   You can provide default values for parameters in case the caller does not provide an argument for those parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "       print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",

        "   greet(\"Alice\") # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Keyword Arguments**\n",
        "   You can call a function with keyword arguments, which means you explicitly specify which parameter you are passing a value to, regardless of the order.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name, age):\n",

        "\n",
        "7. **Arbitrary Arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`)**\n",
        "   - **`*args`** allows you to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Exception handling** in Python is used to manage errors (or exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program. It allows the programmer to handle errors gracefully, instead of letting the program crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",

        "   The code that may raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the control moves to the `except` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`except` block**:\n",
        "   The `except` block catches and handles the exception. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch or use a general `except` to handle all exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`else` block**:\n",
        "   The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It is optional.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`finally` block**:\n",
        "   The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is useful for cleaning up resources like closing files or database connections.\n",
